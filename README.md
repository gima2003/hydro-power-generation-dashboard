# Hydro Power Generation Prediction System

An AI-driven decision support dashboard designed to predict and analyze hydropower generation availability in Sri Lanka using climate and reservoir data.

This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be combined with modern data visualization to support energy planning, risk assessment, and operational decision-making for national power authorities.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Hydropower generation is highly dependent on rainfall patterns and reservoir water levels. This system forecasts short-term hydropower availability and highlights potential risk conditions to help planners make informed decisions.

The project is implemented as an end-to-end system consisting of:
- A machine learning pipeline for prediction
- A decision-support dashboard for visualization and interpretation
